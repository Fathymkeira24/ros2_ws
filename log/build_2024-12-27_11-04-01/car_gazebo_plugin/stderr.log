[33mCMake Warning (dev) at /usr/share/cmake-3.22/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (PkgConfig)
  does not match the name of the calling package (gazebo).  This can lead to
  problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.

[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:24 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findsmartcar_msgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "smartcar_msgs", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "smartcar_msgs"
  with any of the following names:

    smartcar_msgsConfig.cmake
    smartcar_msgs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "smartcar_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "smartcar_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "smartcar_msgs" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
